/*
This script runs every time the pop-up window is opened. When it runs, the following things happen:
1. The script registers to receive messages so that the list dropdown can be updated if the service
worker sends a message that new wish lists have been fetched.
2. The service worker is triggered to fetch wish lists from the server so that the wish lists the user
looks at will be up-to-date. The service worker is the process that fetches the lists so that fetching
continues properly if the pop-up window closes.
3. The list dropdown is updated according to the current wish lists stored in memory. These will usually
be accurate, but sometimes there may have been a change on the server not yet reflected locally. This
is fine because the service worker is already fetching the up-to-date lists, and the dropdown will
be updated by the listener once the lists have been fetched. This will probably happen before the user
even clicks the dropdown, so everything will be accurate. If all else fails, the lists stored in
memory will be accurate the next time the user opens the pop-up window, which this script pulls from.
